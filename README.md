Simple script to update Octoprint when running in a Python venv on Windows 10 or 11.
To use:
  1. Edit the variables at the beginning of the script to reflect your installation
  2. Run the file using Powershell. It shouldn't matter if you run it as admin, as long as your user account has admin permissions.
  3. Follow the prompts given by the script. A reboot is recommended but may not be required.
